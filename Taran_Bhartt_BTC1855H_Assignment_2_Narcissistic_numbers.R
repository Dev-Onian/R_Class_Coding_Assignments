#' 1. Prompt the user to enter a three digit positive number
#' Plan: Need to include a print function for the query
#'       Need to figure out how to ask for a prompt
#'       Might need to be a readline function

#' 2. Check if the user input is numeric. If not, print an error message and quit.
#' Plan: Will probably need to use the is.numeric function
#'       Will also need to use a print function, where the output will vary
#'       depending on the logical result of the is.numeric function


#' 3. Check if the number is narcissistic. A narcissistic number, or an Armstrong
#'    number, is a number that is equal to the sum of the cubes of its own digits. 
#'    153, 370, 371, 407 are three digit Armstrong numbers.
#' plan: Similar setup to the above number, though there is an initial step
#'       Would it be easier to break it up as a string?
#'       There may be a separate function


#' 4. Display the result with an appropriate message, e.g. 
#'    “127 is not an Armstrong number” or “370 is a narcissistic number” 
#'    or any additional fun text you may want to add.
#' plan: similar steps to checking whether or not the input is numeric
